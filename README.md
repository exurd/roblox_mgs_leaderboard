This is a Python script that extracts the infomation on the three toplists for the platform "Roblox" on [MetaGamerScore](https://metagamerscore.com/) and saves it to three seperate JSON files.

The repository uses GitHub Workflows to update the JSON files every 6 hours.

## Toplists available
- [score](score_rblx.json)
- [completist](completist_rblx.json)
- [firsts](firsts_rblx.json)

You need to have the packages [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests) and [BeautifulSoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4) installed.
